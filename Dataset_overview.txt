NASA Bearing Dataset Description

Overview
This NASA Bearing Dataset contains raw vibration sensor data collected from multiple tests of bearings running until failure. It is designed to support predictive maintenance research by providing real-world time-series vibration recordings.

Data Structure
The dataset consists of multiple folders corresponding to different tests:

1st test/
2nd test/
3rd test/

Each folder contains multiple snapshot files named by timestamp (e.g., 2003.10.23.00.54.13).

Each snapshot file records 20,000 vibration amplitude measurements sampled over 1 second at 20,000 Hz frequency.

The vibration data reflects the healthy state through to various stages of bearing wear and eventual failure.

Usage Notes
The data files are large and can take up multiple gigabytes. It is recommended to use sample subsets or downsampled versions for quick experiments.

The dataset is public and can be downloaded from the official NASA Prognostics Data Repository:

Integration with Code
Update your analysis scripts' folder_path variable to point to the location where you download and extract this dataset.

Use the provided folders and filenames to load vibration snapshots for feature extraction and anomaly detection.
